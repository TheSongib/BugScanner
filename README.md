# Bug Bounty Scanner

A distributed, automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning platform for bug bounty hunting. Built in Go with a pipeline architecture that chains together the industry-standard ProjectDiscovery tool suite.

## How It Works

When you submit a target domain, the system runs a 5-stage pipeline automatically:

```
Target Domain
     │
     ▼
[1] Asset Discovery      subfinder + shuffledns → finds all subdomains
     │
     ▼
[2] Port Scanning        naabu → finds open ports on live hosts (TCP connect scan)
     │
     ▼
[3] HTTP Probing         httpx → identifies live web services + tech stack
     │
     ▼
[4] Crawling             katana → maps endpoints, JS files, API routes, HTML forms
     │
     ▼
[5] Vulnerability Scan   nuclei → 4-pass scan:
                           Pass 1: exposures + misconfigs + exposed panels
                           Pass 2: DAST fuzzing (GET params — SQLi, XSS, redirects)
                           Pass 3: POST form DAST (login forms, search boxes, etc.)
                           Pass 4: CVE scan (critical + high severity only)
     │
     ▼
Results stored in PostgreSQL + Discord/Slack alert on findings
```

Everything runs concurrently across distributed workers. You can scale to 50 workers in parallel to cover large scopes in minutes.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) — must be installed and **running**
- That's it. Everything else runs inside Docker.

---

## Quick Start (New Computer Setup)

### 1. Clone / copy the project

```bash
cd /path/to/Bug\ Scanner
```

### 2. Configure notifications (optional but recommended)

Copy the example env file:

```bash
cp deployments/.env.example deployments/.env
```

Edit `deployments/.env` and add your webhook URLs:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=changeme
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=3
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE
```

To get a Discord webhook: Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy URL

### 3. Start everything

```bash
make up
```

This builds and starts all 5 containers:
- **PostgreSQL** — stores all scan data
- **Redis** — enforces rate limits
- **RabbitMQ** — job queue between orchestrator and workers
- **Orchestrator** — HTTP API server on port 8080
- **Worker** (×2) — runs the scanning tools

**First build takes 3–5 minutes** (downloading tool images). Subsequent starts are instant.

### 4. Verify everything is running

```bash
make logs
```

You should see the orchestrator and both workers connect successfully. Or check container status:

```bash
docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml ps
```

All containers should show `healthy` or `running`.

### 5. Test the API

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### 6. Import the Postman collection (optional)

A ready-to-use Postman collection is included at `execution scripts/Basic Runs.postman_collection.json`.

Import it into Postman (**File → Import**) and you get:
- **Create Scan** — fires a scan and automatically saves the returned `scan_id` as a collection variable
- **Scan Status** — checks progress using `{{scan_id}}`
- **Get Results** — fetches vulnerability findings using `{{scan_id}}`
- **List All Runs** — lists all scans
- **Cancel Run** — cancels the current `{{scan_id}}`

Run **Create Scan** first — every subsequent request will automatically target that scan.

---

## Usage

### Start a Scan

Submit a target domain. The scan kicks off immediately and runs the full 5-stage pipeline in the background.

**Basic scan (auto-generates scope for all subdomains):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "hackerone.com"}'
```

**Scan with explicit scope (recommended for bug bounties):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target": "hackerone.com",
    "scope_in": [
      ".*\\.hackerone\\.com$",
      ".*\\.hackerone-ext-content\\.com$"
    ],
    "scope_out": [
      "^www\\.hackerone\\.com$",
      ".*\\.vpn\\.hackerone\\.com$"
    ]
  }'
```

`scope_in` — regex patterns that assets **must** match to be scanned
`scope_out` — regex patterns that assets matching these are **excluded** (never scanned)

Response:
```json
{
  "scan": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "running",
    "target": "hackerone.com",
    "created_at": "2026-03-08T00:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

Save the `id` — you'll use it to check results.

---

### Check Scan Status & Progress

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 | jq .
```

Response shows the scan plus each pipeline stage's job status:
```json
{
  "scan": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "running",
    "target": "hackerone.com"
  },
  "jobs": [
    { "stage": "discovery",  "status": "completed", "output_count": 142 },
    { "stage": "portscan",   "status": "completed", "output_count": 89  },
    { "stage": "httpprobe",  "status": "running",   "output_count": 0   },
    { "stage": "crawl",      "status": "pending",   "output_count": 0   },
    { "stage": "vulnscan",   "status": "pending",   "output_count": 0   }
  ]
}
```

Scan `status` values: `pending` → `running` → `completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`

---

### Get Vulnerability Results

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/results | jq .
```

Results are sorted by severity (critical first):
```json
{
  "scan": { "id": "...", "status": "completed" },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "template_id": "CVE-2021-44228",
      "template_name": "Apache Log4j RCE",
      "severity": "critical",
      "matched_url": "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/login",
      "curl_command": "curl -X POST ...",
      "created_at": "2026-03-08T01:15:00Z"
    },
    {
      "template_id": "exposed-git-config",
      "severity": "medium",
      "matched_url": "https://assets.hackerone.com/.git/config"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### List All Scans

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans?limit=20&offset=0" | jq .
```

---

### List Vulnerabilities by Severity

```bash
# All critical findings across all scans
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vulnerabilities?severity=critical" | jq .

# All findings for a specific scan
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vulnerabilities?scan_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" | jq .
```

Severity levels: `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`

---

### Cancel a Running Scan

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/cancel
```

---

### Mark a Finding as False Positive

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vulnerabilities/abc123/false-positive \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "WAF blocks this, not exploitable"}'
```

---

### Mark a Finding as Triaged (Reported)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vulnerabilities/abc123/triage \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Reported to HackerOne - report #123456"}'
```

---

## Scaling Workers

The more workers running, the faster scans complete on large scopes. Scale up:

```bash
# Run 5 workers in parallel
make scale-workers WORKERS=5

# Run 10 workers for a massive scope
make scale-workers WORKERS=10
```

Scale back down when done to save resources:

```bash
make scale-workers WORKERS=1
```

---

## Viewing Live Logs

```bash
make logs                # all containers
make logs-worker         # worker output (tool execution, findings)
make logs-orchestrator   # API server logs (requests, errors)
```

Worker logs show each tool execution in real time:
```
{"level":"INFO","msg":"executing tool","tool":"subfinder","args":["-d","hackerone.com"]}
{"level":"INFO","msg":"tool completed","tool":"subfinder","duration":"8.2s","stdout_len":4821}
{"level":"INFO","msg":"discovery complete","domain":"hackerone.com","subdomains_found":142}
{"level":"INFO","msg":"vulnerability found","template":"exposed-git-config","severity":"medium","url":"https://..."}
```

---

## RabbitMQ Management UI

You can visually inspect the job queues in your browser:

```
http://localhost:15672
Username: scanner
Password: changeme
```

Shows queue depths, message rates, and consumer counts for each pipeline stage.

---

## Stopping & Restarting

```bash
# Stop everything (data is preserved in Docker volumes)
make down

# Start again (instant, no rebuild)
make up

# Stop and delete ALL data (wipe the database)
docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

---

## Notifications Setup

When a medium/high/critical vulnerability is found, the system fires a webhook immediately.

**Discord:** Create a webhook in your server under Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks. Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in `deployments/.env`.

**Slack:** Create an incoming webhook app at api.slack.com. Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in `deployments/.env`.

**Minimum severity to notify** (default: `medium`):
Edit `configs/config.yaml`:
```yaml
notify:
  min_severity: "high"   # only ping for high and critical
```

Restart workers after changing config: `make down && make up`

---

## Configuration Reference

All settings live in `configs/config.yaml` and can be overridden with environment variables.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `server.port` | `8080` | API server port |
| `worker.concurrency` | `3` | Jobs per worker container processed simultaneously |
| `rate_limit.per_target` | `30` | Max requests/sec to any single target |
| `rate_limit.per_tool.nuclei` | `50` | Max nuclei requests/sec |
| `rate_limit.per_tool.naabu` | `200` | Max port scan packets/sec |
| `notify.min_severity` | `medium` | Minimum severity to trigger webhook alert |

**Important:** Keep `rate_limit.per_target` reasonable (≤50 rps). Blasting a target with thousands of requests per second is an accidental DoS attack and will get you banned from bug bounty programs.

## Bug Bounty Workflow

1. Find a program on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) or [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com)
2. Read the scope carefully — note which domains are in-scope and out-of-scope
3. Start a scan with explicit `scope_in` and `scope_out` patterns matching the program rules
4. Watch `make logs-worker` for live findings
5. When something interesting surfaces, check the `curl_command` field in the result — it gives you the exact request to reproduce it manually
6. Verify the finding is real (not a false positive) before reporting
7. Mark it triaged with your report number: `POST /vulnerabilities/{id}/triage`

## Troubleshooting

**Containers won't start:**
Make sure Docker Desktop is open and running before any `make` commands.

**Port already in use:**
```bash
make down   # stop existing containers first
make up
```

**Scan stuck in "running" with no progress:**
Check worker logs for errors: `make logs-worker`
The most common cause is a tool failing — the worker logs the exact error.

**`jq` command not found:**
```bash
brew install jq
```

**Want to inspect the database directly:**
```bash
docker exec -it deployments-postgres-1 psql -U scanner -d bugscanner
```
Then run standard SQL: `SELECT * FROM scans;`, `SELECT severity, count(*) FROM vulnerabilities GROUP BY severity;`

**Scan terminates at port scan with 0 ports found:**
The target may be temporarily unreachable, or the target has no open web ports. Check worker logs for details. The scanner uses TCP connect scan which works in all Docker environments.

**Scan reaches httpx but finds 0 live services:**
This is usually a transient network issue. The port scanner runs web-ports-only to avoid disrupting Docker's connection tracking. Retry the scan.

**shuffledns fails with "could not find massdns binary":**
Your worker image is out of date. Rebuild: `docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml build worker && docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml up -d worker`

**Good test target for verifying the scanner works:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "scanme.nmap.org"}'
```
`scanme.nmap.org` is Nmap's official test server (explicitly permitted for scanning). Expect ~6 minutes to complete. Typical findings: Apache mod_negotiation listing (low), missing security headers (info).
